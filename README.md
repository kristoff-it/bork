- Displays Twitch emotes in the terminal, **including your custom emotes!**  
- Understands Twitch-specifict concepts (subcriptions, gifted subs, ...). 
- Displays badges for your subs, mods, etc.
- Supports clearing chat and deletes messages from banned users. 
- Click on a message to highlight it and let your viewers know who you're relpying to. 

## Why?
Many livecoders show their chat feed on stream. It makes sense for the livecoding genre, since the content is text-heavy and you want viewers to be aware of all social interactions taking place, even when they put the video in full screen mode.

It's also common to use terminal applications to show chat on screen, partially out of convenience, partially because of the appeal of the terminal aestetic. Unfortunately the most common solution, irssi, is an IRC client that can show basic Twitch messages, but that doesn't understand any of the Twitch-specific concepts such as subs, sub gifts, highlighted messages, etc.

Bork is designed to replace irssi for this usecase by providing all the functionality that a general-purpose IRC client can't provide.

## Requirements
To be able to see emotes in the terminal, you muyst use [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), or any terminal emulator that supports the Kitty image protocol.
Bork will otherwise fallback to showing the emote name (eg Kappa).
