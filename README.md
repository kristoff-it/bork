# bork

A Twitch chat client for the terminal.

Unlike irssi, bork is not an IRC client. This means that bork supports concepts unique to Twitch such as new subscriptions, sub gifts, highlighted messages, and more.

bork also supports rendering twitch emotes to the terminal!

bork is meant to be used as a twitch chat feed to be displayed on stream.

Currently in alpha stage.

A better readme will be written once I manage to learn Colemak. At the moment life is pain.

## Demo
